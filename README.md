# Philadelphia Stadium Events

This is a csv version of the data that appears on the [Stadium Complex District](https://scssd.org/sports-complex-info/)'s website. They don't make it available in a format that's compatible with my lifestyle, so I'm manually updating it here. 

The folder `traffic-alerts` contains Python scripts that you can run daily and weekly that will give you a summary in Discord of the upcoming events in the Stadium district.

If anyone thinks they can create a reliable Python script that converts the pdfs on the Stadium Complex website to csvs, please feel free to take on that challenge. I've put my efforts in the folder `working` (although they currently clearly do not).
